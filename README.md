##This is a collaborative project between Motaz Hassan and Clinton Mokaya. This is towards the ALX software engineering course.
##The following are handled regarding sorting algorithms:
	At least four different sorting algorithms
	What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
	How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
	What is a stable sorting algorithm
